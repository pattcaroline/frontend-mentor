## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS / SCSS

### What I learned

I built this project using SCSS for the first time. At the beginning it was very slow process, but now I really enjoy using SCSS. It makes the process of designing a lot easier.

### Continued development

I'll continue improving this SCSS files. I would like to create a folder for the layout separetly.
