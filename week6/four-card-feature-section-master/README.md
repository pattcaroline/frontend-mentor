## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass/Scss

### What I learned

I learned to create mixins for spaces, typography and variables first and then speed up the process of designing and working faster in the layout.

### Continued development

I'll focus in organizing my scss files better. Use appropriate name for the files and classes.

### Useful resources
